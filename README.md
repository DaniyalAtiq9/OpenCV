This repository is created to upload my computer vision projects. I'm a beginner in cv so, I have taken help from "OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python"

The Docs folder contains my personal documentation of OpenCV which is a thing in progress. I have tried to break it down in simple terms, some code files such as draw.py
and colorspaces.py include their documentation.
I want to emphasize that I am a novice and I can make mistakes, therefore feel free to contribute ;/
