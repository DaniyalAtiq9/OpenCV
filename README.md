This repository is created to upload my computer vision projects. I'm a beginner in cv so, I have taken help from "OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python"

The Docs folder contains my personal documentation of OpenCV which is a thing in progress. I have tried to break it down in simple terms, some code files such as draw.py, colorspaces.py, splitmerge.py, and smoothing.py have their explanation inside the code files in comments.
I want to emphasize that I am a novice and I can make mistakes, therefore feel free to contribute ;/
Follow the files in following manner:
read.py ->
rescale.py ->
draw.py ->
basic.py ->
transformations.py ->
contours.py ->
colorspaces.py ->
splitmerge.py ->
smoothing.py
